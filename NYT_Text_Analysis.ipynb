      "Sprawled on grass, floating down a river, or gazing blankly into the distance  all the subjects captured, unawares, in the photographer Paddy Summerfields new book The Oxford Pictures share a certain listlessness. In 1968, having been thrown out of Guildford School of Art (the staff werent particularly sympathetic towards my vision), Summerfield returned to his hometown of Oxford, England. He spent the summers of the next 10 years wandering around the grounds of the elite Oxford University, where he photographed students at leisure.What he sensed at the university, he says, was an atmosphere that mirrored how he felt about his own life. I was young, he says, Its a young persons vision, noticing girls and noticing other peoples relationships  but I was always outside everything. He recognized a similar nervousness in the subjects of his photos, who hovered between the social rituals of university and an existential uncertainty. At the time, Summerfield was heavily influenced by John Lennon  and there is something personal and deeply melancholy about these images. I set out to show heartache and disappointment, he says. Its about feeling well, I suppose, isolated and lonely, and full of sexual anxiety.Some of the most striking photographs in the book are those of students lying in the grounds of the campus, presumably asleep in the sun. They are crumpled into one another, arms often flung outwards; its not immediately clear whether theyre dead or alive. Theres one of a girl who is lying down, and her skirt has slightly risen, and she does look as though shes falling, in a dream, says Summerfield. Years later, he came across photographer I. Russel Sorgis 1942 image of a woman in the act of suicide, falling from an eighth-floor window: Her body language is exactly the same as that woman, that girl lying on the grass, Summerfield says.A selection of Summerfields pictures was shown at the Museum of Modern Art Oxford in 1976. But this month, 40 years later, they become the subject of a new book. Summerfield says that the fashionable British documentary photographers of the time  Don McCullin, David Hurn, Ian Berry, Tony Ray Jones  were more preoccupied with society than with introspection. They were interested in the world around them, he says. Im interested in the interior world. (top topic: 19)\n",
      "Only weeks after Allergan spent nearly $1 billion to acquire the rights to a new drug for migraine headaches, the Food and Drug Administration has rejected the product.Allergan said Tuesday morning that the F.D.A. had declined to approve the drug, Levadex, because of concerns about the manufacturing of the inhaler used to dispense it.Levadex is a new version of DHE, or dihydroergotamine, which has been used to treat acute migraines for decades, but which is usually given by intravenous infusion, requiring patients to get to a hospital in the midst of a migraine attack.Levadex, by contrast, is inhaled using a device similar to those used for asthma, allowing patients to treat themselves at home.In January, Allergan agreed to pay $958 million to acquire MAP Pharmaceuticals, the Silicon Valley biotechnology company that developed Levadex. The deal closed just last month.The F.D.A. had declined to approve Levadex in March 2012, a decision MAP said was tied to the agencys concerns about the inhaler. Allergans agreement to purchase MAP before waiting for the F.D.A.s second decision this month suggested it was confident that Levadex would be approved.Allergan said Tuesday that the F.D.A., in its letter explaining its decision to decline approval for the second time, expressed concerns about findings from an inspection of the company that was filling the canisters. The agency also had concerns about the manufacturing process for the final filled canisters.The F.D.A. does not publicly discuss its conversations with applicants, citing requirements for confidentiality.Allergan said it had already taken steps to fix the problems. This month it acquired the canister-filling company Exemplar Pharma for less than $20 million and installed its own executives to run the operation.Allergan is committed to vigorously address the concerns raised by the F.D.A., the company said in its news release. It said it hoped it would have another chance to win approval at the end of this year.Allergan, based in Irvine, Calif., is most known for its drug Botox, a bacterial toxin used to treat various medical conditions as well as to smooth wrinkles.One approved use of Botox is to prevent migraines. Allergan hopes that Levadex, which is used after a migraine has begun, would be complementary, and analysts had expected annual sales of hundreds of millions of dollars. The company said failure to win approval would not materially affect its sales guidance for the year.More than 30 million Americans are said to suffer from migraine headaches. While there are various drugs available, headache specialists say many patients still do not receive adequate pain relief. (top topic: 21)\n",
      "Johnson & Johnson reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, as strong growth for prescription drugs overshadowed weaker contributions from its medical device and consumer products businesses.The companys pharmaceuticals division is really well placed with lots of new drug launches at a time when the company is not facing many patent expirations on its other medicines, a Morningstar analyst, Damien Conover, said. And we expect to see more of this strength in the next several quarters.Global drug revenue jumped almost 10 percent to $7.04 billion.But sales of the companys medical devices were hurt by patients continuing reluctance to undergo elective surgeries and other procedures in a weak economy. Division sales fell 2 percent to $6.93 billion.The weakness in devices appears to be broad-based, with not just one thing bringing them down, Judson Clark, an analyst at Edward Jones said, adding that the units weakest category was medical diagnostics.J.& J.s chief financial officer, Dominic J. Caruso, said on a conference call with analysts and investors that there had been a pickup in overall economic activity, but certainly not to the level we had hoped.Johnson & Johnson reported net earnings of $2.98 billion, or $1.04 a share, for the third quarter, compared with $2.97 billion, or $1.05 a share a year earlier.Excluding one-time items, J.& J. earned $1.36 a share. Analysts on average, had expected $1.32 a share, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. The company took special charges of about $900 million in the quarter, related largely to legal expenses and merger-related costs.Overall company sales rose 3.1 percent to $17.58 billion in the quarter, above Wall Street expectations of $17.46 billion, but would have risen 4.7 percent if not for the stronger dollar.J.& J. said it expected earnings this year, excluding special items, of $5.44 to $5.49 a share, up from its previous view of between $5.40 to $5.47. The company earned $5.10 a share last year. (top topic: 2)\n",
      "Zooming through a Stockholm intersection on his bicycle one morning, 18-year-old Max Tegmark never saw the truck that hit him. The blast of a horn, the screech of tires and a sickening thud followed in quick succession, extinguishing a young life filled with promise.It never happened, of course. As the adult Dr. Tegmark, now 46, relates in the opening pages of this provocative new book, young Max swerved at the last instant and continued on to school  and an academic career that eventually took him to the faculty of M.I.T. and the top ranks of the worlds cosmologists.But wait: That fatal accident did happen, Dr. Tegmark writes. Yes, he came through unscathed that day, but he was also killed, and he was severely injured, and slightly injured. He endured every possible outcome, happy and unhappy, that can befall a bicyclist who encounters a speeding truck.All of these happened, he argues, because everything that can happen does happen  in at least one of an infinite number of universes.If you find this far-fetched, you are hardly alone. The idea of parallel universes, in which events diverge from those in our own reality, is usually the domain of science fiction. But Dr. Tegmark is a scientist, not a novelist, and he makes a powerful case, leading us step by logical step from well-established mainstream science into ever stranger territory.Each step along the way seems entirely reasonable, so that by the time we arrive at Dr. Tegmarks multiverse, in which all that can be is, we are left to wonder: Can this be right? And if not, where did we go wrong?He starts the journey in the ancient world, when Greek scholars used brilliantly creative geometrical methods to estimate the circumference of the earth, the size of the moon and the distance to the sun. From there he moves through the discoveries that established the universe as it is known to scientists today: our solar system, the Milky Way, the innumerable galaxies all racing away from one another as the universe expands and expands. He argues that there is no reason to think the Big Bang was a unique event, so one should assume countless other universes. This is science writing at its best  dynamic, dramatic and accessible.But then things get stranger. Dr. Tegmark narrows his focus to the building blocks of matter, the elementary particles governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. The position of a particle at a given time is described by its wavefunction, but this provides only a probable distribution of locations, not an absolutely determined one.The classic Copenhagen interpretation, devised by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in the 1920s, resolved this problem by positing that the wavefunction collapses into a specific location when a measurement is made. But Dr. Tegmark rejects this as an improvised and implausible solution. The wavefunction never collapses, he argues, and all its different values continue to exist side by side.What all this means is that the universe is constantly splitting into more and more realities, in each of which the particle is in one of its possible locations.Nor is this splitting limited to the microscopic scale of quantum physics. Since we are made of elementary particles, our actions, thoughts and feelings ultimately depend on their position, and our world, too, is constantly splitting into all its possibilities.Dr. Tegmarks ultimate reality is one in which anything that is mathematically possible actually exists, but there is nothing that is not mathematical. Our reality, in other words, is not just described by mathematics, it is mathematics.The vision of a purely mathematical universe, one that can be understood solely through rigorous mathematical reasoning, is far from new. As far back as the sixth century B.C., the Pythagoreans declared that all is number, and in the 17th century A.D. Descartes tried to deduce the universe from first principles. Other 17th-century rationalists, including Hobbes and Leibniz, offered their own versions of the mathematical universe.Such efforts to comprehend the world entirely through mathematical reasoning certainly had their triumphs, none more so than when Einstein upended our universe using nothing more than careful reasoning and mathematical calculations.But the overall record for such attempts is decidedly mixed: The Pythagoreans, who insisted that everything was made of whole numbers and their ratios, foundered on the discovery of irrationals, and Descartes concluded that matter was simple extension in space, that a vacuum was impossible and that the planets swirled in vortexes of ether.It is difficult to say whether Dr. Tegmarks mathematical universe will ultimately be deemed an Einsteinian triumph or a Cartesian dead end. His conclusions are simply too far removed from the frontiers of todays mainstream science, and there is little hope that conclusive evidence will emerge anytime soon.Yet Our Mathematical Universe is nothing if not impressive. Brilliantly argued and beautifully written, it is never less than thought-provoking about the greatest mysteries of our existence. It may be sheer coincidence that we live in a universe in which Max Tegmark survived a very close call on the streets of Stockholm. But after reading his book, I am convinced we are fortunate that we do. (top topic: 18)\n",

      "In a small Brooklyn apartment, Jacob Winterhalt, a former Air Force airman, looked on as his 3-year-old daughter, Raya, and her best friend, Doris, chased each other. The girls wore sneakers. Doriss were equipped with red lights that flashed with the urgency of a distress beacon.No shoes in the house, you silly goose, Mr. Winterhalt said. Unless those are special shoes.Ive got to go to work, Raya said.Ive got to go to work, too, Doris said.O.K., said Mr. Winterhalt, 35. Have a good day.With that, he sat down at the kitchen table. The girls went back to running around the tight space as Sampa, a 7-year-old English bulldog, barked at no one in particular. Nearby, Doriss father, Joachim Carels, 39, who used to work in the fashion industry, lounged on the couch.At that moment, it was not lost on me that taking care of the two little ones had been the work of both men for the last three years.As their children grew close, these two men from very different backgrounds developed a friendship of their own, finding kinship and trust in the sometimes lonely existence of men who choose to be principal caretakers, while their wives spend workday hours at the office.They trust each other, Ana Zaldarriaga, Mr. Winterhalts wife, said during an interview a few days later at her Midtown office. I think Jake said something to Joachim, and I said: Why are you telling Joachim that? Why are you sharing that outside our circle of knowledge? And he said: That is my bro. I can talk to him about these things.They talk about their wives, she said. They talk about their future careers. They talk about their passions. They talk about their child-rearing. They talk about money.The mens bond started by accident. In January 2015, Mr. Carels (whom I grew up with in Ohio) stood outside Mr. Winterhalts door, cursing. One of the construction projects defining the Brooklyn streetscape was underway, and he found that his car had been towed.Nearby, Mr. Winterhalt smoked a hand-rolled cigarette and laughed  he had gotten three tickets for doing the same thing. The two men began to talk. They had seen each other in the neighborhood but had never really spoken. It turned out their daughters were the same age, born just a month apart.The two dads and two girls hung out a few times before an arrangement took shape: Each father would drop his daughter off at the others house for a few hours one day a week. Their wives were skeptical at first. After all, each husband was handing over a daughter to a stranger.That a genuine friendship between them evolved seems a little strange to Mr. Winterhalt and Mr. Carels, even now. Unlike other male bonds, those forged through music or sports or work, theirs was formed between two guys who did not seem to have much in common.You get sucked into the kids zone, Mr. Carels said. So its good to have a connection to reality, whatever that reality is.Mr. Winterhalt said: Any time you go through a period in life when you feel like youre alone, its nice to find someone to realize its not just me having these feelings. Theres another person whos a stay-at-home-dad who has similar concerns, with a similar personality, and we can process that with each other.Growing up on a farm in upstate New York, Mr. Winterhalt was aimless after high school. He did a stint at a community college before going into the military.He joined the Air Force in 1999 with a plan to stick it out for four years and then become a police officer. On Sept. 11, he found himself thrown from the world he knew. In his military service that came after, he traveled for assignments that he said he cannot and would not discuss.What he would speak on, briefly, were the effects of the post-traumatic stress disorder he began experiencing shortly after he left the Air Force in 2003. Those effects continue, albeit to a lesser degree, he said.Three years after he left the military, he and Ms. Zaldarriaga, who grew up in Manhattan, began dating. About a year after their 2011 wedding, when she became pregnant (on their first try, the couple said), both were making roughly equal incomes. She had risen to a great position at her company, which provides leadership development in education and business, and he earned decent money teaching at an elementary school in Chelsea and as a bartender on the Upper East Side.But neither couple wanted their daughter to spend her first years in the care of someone else. They believed their girls needed a familial foundation before going off into the world. But who would provide it?It was just kind of accepted that it had to be one of us, Mr. Winterhalt said. And Ana had the benefits. So we really didnt have a choice.I think if you talk with Ana, shell tell you, and Ill tell you, that part of her is envious that she is missing out on this time with her daughter. That is really tough for her, and rightfully so. However, if you ask me, if she knew what it was really like on a day-to-day basis, she wouldnt choose it. I dont say that negatively. Its just factual.For her, it was a hard pill to swallow, to be the one solely financial responsible for the family, Mr. Winterhalt said. Its been a huge transition for both of us. For me to be the one who relies on her financially has not been an easy pill to swallow.Mr. Carels gives the impression that he has handled that transition well. Perhaps thats because he had already put his career in the background when he got a call from his wife, Rebecca Krauss, as she freaked out while in a Penn Station bathroom in 2012.Mr. Carels, having earned an undergraduate degree in architecture, arrived in New York in 2000 and earned an associate degree in fashion design from Parsons School of Design. Afterward, he entered the production side of fashion, where he spent the better part of a decade.He met Ms. Krauss, an acupuncturist, herbalist and medical qi gong practitioner, while studying Acroyoga with her in 2008 at a Manhattan studio. Within a year and a half, they got married at City Hall, after which they moved to Colorado so she could finish her training in the use of Chinese herbs.During that time, Ms. Krauss, who is originally from Long Island, traveled to New York once a month to see clients, which is where she was on that day in 2012 when she found out she was pregnant  in one of the worlds busiest train stations.In Colorado, they had help with the baby, with Mr. Carels working full time at a bike store while Ms. Krauss finished school. When she completed her studies in 2013, they moved in with her family in East Meadow, N.Y., where Mr. Carels took over the primary duties of caring for Doris.When Ms. Krausss business took off, they moved to Brooklyn. Mr. Carels knew a return to the fashion business would mean starting over. So he stayed at home.Whatever money I was going to make was going to go toward paying someone to watch Doris, Mr. Carels said. It didnt seem mathematically to make sense. And I enjoy staying home with Doris and believe that some amount of her precociousness and language skill has something to do with the fact that I was at home with her and so engaged.Both Mr. Winterhalt and Mr. Carels can be loners. Neither actively seeks new relationships, though each maintains a small group of lifelong friends. This was something that concerned their spouses. Ms. Zaldarriaga said she knew her husband would take great care of Raya, but she didnt know if he would take care of himself.Both men said that they take a dim view of groups for stay-at-home fathers. For them, the concept seems forced. Mr. Carels tried it out a number of times, but it just wasnt for him.And at some level, why are you going? Mr. Carels asked. Are you going for you or your kid?The two fathers recently took the girls to Underwood Park in Brooklyn, talking while their daughters played. A mother commented that they must be part of some Meetup or a dads collective.No, Mr. Carels said in answer. Were just parents hanging out, like you.Besides, since they found each other, they have no real need for such a group.We joke about this, Mr. Carels said of his friendship with Mr. Winterhalt, because every time we hang out, there is some similarity that is remarkable. Some part of our life is similar enough, even though the stuff in between was radically different. There is something that makes it easy to connect with him. And the shared experience for the last three years, obviously, is enough to give us tons of stuff to talk about.The difficulties they face are akin to those experienced by generations of mothers. They, too, have suffered from a sense of isolation, often followed by the daunting task of rejoining the work force after years at home.Now, with Raya and Doris ready to enter preschool, the two fathers are feeling untethered.My passion for the last years has been my family, Mr. Winterhalt said. So I dont know what Im going to do as a job. I dont have any idea. The world is mine, and thats a great thing. Do I go back to school? I dont know. That is a little scary for me.Mr. Carels expressed similar feelings. I cant go back to some stupid job thats 9-to-5 with two weeks of vacation, he said. That doesnt fit into what weve established or what we want. Im not going to go to a bank to apply to be a teller. I have to discover how to find something I want to do and fit it in with how it will work for us.For the moment, anyway, this remains their life: two little girls running around the room, the bulldog barking, the sneakers flashing.

      "Gordie Howe was known to generations of players and fans as Mr. Hockey.But after his death at age 88, many in the hockey world were remembering him as something else: Mr. Nice Guy.For all the tales of Howes on-ice toughness  the elbows, the hard checks  it was his unassuming kindness off the ice that so many recalled.Unfortunately, we lost the greatest hockey player ever today, but more importantly, the nicest man I have ever met, Wayne Gretzky, hockeys Great One, wrote on Twitter.The word gentleman was used again and again by those around hockey to describe Howe.A great player in a sport that is our favorite sport in this country, Brendan Shanahan, a former Red Wings player who is now the president of the Toronto Maple Leafs, told The Toronto Star. Then, on the flip side, when he got off the ice, he was a kind gentleman.Tony Granato, a former Red Wings assistant coach, called Howe a gentleman, a true gentleman and the nicest man you could ever meet.That was not to say that hockey people were not still marveling at Howes accomplishments  26 seasons in the N.H.L. and six more in the World Hockey Association, across five decades. He held the goal-scoring record until Gretzky came along.I pick Gordie as my No. 1 all-time player, said Scotty Bowman, who won nine Stanley Cups as a coach, including three with Detroit.Barry Melrose, a former player and current broadcaster, recalled on ESPN, He was a guy who would hurt you physically, and score two goals to beat you.Noting that Howe had recorded 41 points in his final season, 1979-80, at age 52, Melrose added: Its mind-boggling how long he played. The guy was just a freak of nature to be playing that good at that age.Howe still holds the N.H.L. record for regular-season games played, with 1,767 over 26 seasons. The league plans to honor Howe before Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals in San Jose, Calif., on Sunday night.Gordies toughness as a competitor on the ice was equaled only by his humor and humility away from it., N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. No sport could have hoped for a greater, more beloved ambassador.Few were surprised by Howes passing. He had received a diagnosis of dementia in 2012 and had a serious stroke in 2014.Nevertheless, the news hit his hometown, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, hard. Flags in the city  which is near Floral, the small unincorporated town where Howe was born  were flying at half-staff on Friday. A banner with Howes No. 9 was flying over the citys ice arena, where fans were leaving flowers, cards, teddy bears and other mementos at a statue of Howe.Theres a real feeling of sadness in the city because, even though Gordie played in Detroit, we still know he was from here, and he always kept that connection to Saskatoon and still has family here, said Kevin Mitchell, a reporter at The StarPhoenix, the citys daily newspaper.Howes stature loomed over the Detroit Red Wings, for whom he played 25 seasons, beginning in 1946, and won four Stanley Cups.In Detroit, some Red Wings fans gathered at Joe Louis Arena, the stadium named for the only other local athlete who can stand with Howe in the estimation of many Detroiters.Calls poured into radio shows remembering Howe, mostly for his on-ice exploits. John Bacon, a best-selling sportswriter, eulogized Howe for National Public Radio, crediting him for playing a key role in popularizing hockey in the United States.When he was in his heyday, it was Gordie Howe, Bobby Orr and Bobby Hull, Bacon said. When those three guys were playing, rinks started popping up where they were playing.In Bacons view, that laid the groundwork for the 1980 Miracle on Ice.Speaking in Detroit, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said Howe had been both a gentleman and a tough guy  the best of what Canadians like to think of themselves as.From Washington, President Obama said in a statement that Howes perseverance and humility personified Detroit.The greatest players define their game for a generation; over more than half a century on the ice, Mr. Hockey defined it for a lifetime, Obama said.After Howes playing days were over, he was a regular visitor to Red Wings games and team events, including charity fund-raisers and Stanley Cup celebrations.He embodied, on and off the ice, what it meant to be both a Red Wing and a Detroiter, the Red Wings owner Mike Ilitch said in a statement. He was tough, skilled, and consistently earned success at the highest level.Granato, who played for the Rangers, the Los Angeles Kings and the San Jose Sharks, remembered the effect of Howes presence.Hed come to Joe Louis, and when the guys heard he was in the building, everyone perked up, Granato said. Im thankful I had the chance to shake his hand a few times.Once, when Granato was in Detroit as an assistant coach with the Pittsburgh Penguins, he noticed Howe outside the visitors dressing room and introduced himself.He was surprised that Howe, a giant of the game, politely asked whether Granato might do him a favor.Do you think I can go back and say hi to the kid? Howe asked, referring to Pittsburghs then-budding star, Sidney Crosby.The news of Howes death spread quickly among former Red Wings players, who, no matter what era they played in, seemed to come to know him.Dave Shand, who played hockey at the University of Michigan and broke into the N.H.L. in 1976, while Howe was still playing, said emails with news of Howes death had spread rapidly among former Red Wings players Friday morning.Shand recalled going up against Howe in a game in 1979, and Howe giving Shand an elbow to the face. The moment of impact was caught by a photographer.It literally looked like half my face was pushed in, Shand said with a laugh.Years later, after a stint with the Wings, Shand came to know Howe fairly well, and they used to joke about the play.He was the most approachable superstar youd ever run into, Shand said. He never made you feel like you were bothering him. (top topic: 18)\n",
      "You could say Rob Connollys competent but slight thriller Edge of Winter is about extreme roughing it. Joel Kinnaman (lately Rick Flag in Suicide Squad) plays Elliot Baker, a down-on-his-luck neer-do-well seeking to reconnect with his sons, Caleb (Percy Hynes White) and Bradley (Tom Holland, the latest Spider-Man). To that end, he has persuaded his ex-wife to let him take them for a hunting expedition in a harsh winter.Elliot is no model parent: Before long he is offering beer to the curious 9- or 10-year-old Caleb, while teaching him the rudiments of riflery, and has him killing a rabbit. Giving the studious, earnest Bradley, whos maybe 13 or 14, his first spin at the wheel of an S.U.V. results in a crash on a remote property they have trespassed onto. During an ill-advised walk across a frozen lake, Bradley crashes through the ice. And when the three take refuge in a seemingly abandoned cabin, the unstable Elliot grows unhinged at the news that the boys are to move to London with their mother and their stepfather. Woe to two outdoorsmen (Shiloh Fernandez and Rossif Sutherland, son of Donald) who stop by.The younger actors are skilled and engaging, with Mr. Holland effortlessly conveying quiet internal activity. Mr. Kinnaman blends menace with glints of sympathetic self-loathing, but his character proves too underdrawn, starved for a back story. For this trip, you might consider staying home.Edge of Winter is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for obscene language and animal viscera. (top topic: 5)\n",

      "Before the action starts, the Bollywood movie Mohenjo Daro assures us that no animals were harmed during its making. More unusual, a note tells us that the film doesnt support or dispute any specific interpretation of ancient Indian civilization. This disclaimer probably isnt necessary. From its first scenes, the movie, set in 2016 B.C., makes its intentions known: This is a heros tale, not history.In those opening scenes, Sarman (the green-eyed pinup Hrithik Roshan) has a David-like victory over an enormous crocodile, whose superior strength is no match for Sarmans cunning, courage and well-placed trident. All in a days work: We soon learn that Sarman is his villages go-to man in life-threatening crises.Like all good heroes, Sarman is an orphan (he lives with his aunt and uncle). He doesnt have a lightning bolt on his forehead, but he has a dream  of a unicorn, which is a clear sign of something ominous, as we see in the worried eyes of his aunt and uncle.Our country boy soon goes off to the big city, Mohenjo Daro, a place he is told is ruled by greed. There he partakes of the polyglot marketplace, witnesses injustice, sees magnificent beasts (horses, brought by traders from Bukhara) and meets  a girl, the Chosen One, played by Pooja Hegde. (Chosen for what, you may wonder: her role consists of being fought over by men.)The real Mohenjo Dara, in what is now Pakistan, comes complete with historical mysteries: why was this city abandoned and why did the Indus Valley civilization, which dates from the third millennium B.C., fade? Whoever the residents of Mohenjo Daro were  and thats not clear  they had a reverence for the control of water, as an article in National Geographic says. They had good drainage. And pools.Mohenjo Daro, written and directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, isnt really interested in how the city worked, or in its ancient bells and whistles. Mr. Gowarikers mind is more on the standard-issue romance between Sarman and the Chosen One, and Sarmans heroic tests.Which is to say that Mohenjo Daro is a typical Bollywood epic-adventure-musical-romance, if one with a novel setting. Mr. Roshan, an appealing dancer, works hard to twinkle his way into our affections and make Sarman something more than a cardboard hero. He cant, but the effort is appreciated.And Mr. Gowariker does provide a version of how the city ended. Viewers, beware, and remember that head note: It almost certainly didnt go down this way!

      "LONDON  Arsenal stayed at the top of the Premier League after scoring two late goals in a 2-0 win over Cardiff, while fellow title rivals Chelsea, Liverpool and Mancheser City also started the year with victories.But the league trophy looks more out of reach than ever for Manchester United after the reigning champions lost, 2-1, at home to Tottenham on Wednesday and fell 11 points behind Arsenal.Nicklas Bendtner and Theo Walcott scored Arsenals goals at Emirates Stadium to beat a resilient Cardiff team that played in front of their expected new manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and frustrated the hosts for 88 minutes in the driving rain.We have a special spirit in the side and you know well fight until the last minute in the game, Arsenal manager Arsne Wenger said.City remained a point behind in second after a 3-2 win at Swansea, while Chelseas 3-0 victory at Southampton in awful weather conditions ensured that Jos Mourinhos team stayed in third place, two points behind the leaders.After two consecutive losses, Liverpool climbed back into the top four after Luis Surez scored his 20th goal of the season in a 2-0 win over Hull.Spurs climbed above United into sixth place  two points behind Liverpool  after goals by Emmanuel Adebayor and Christian Eriksen earned them a second straight league win at Old Trafford. United has now lost four times at home this season.The margin of error has been slim for a long time, United manager David Moyes said of his teams title hopes.Arsenal had to wait until two minutes from time before Bendtner gave the Gunners reasons to celebrate the start of a new year when he pounced from a rebound. The striker picked up an ankle injury while scoring and was substituted before Walcott chipped the ball over goalkeeper David Marshall.He was a bit unlucky; he said he landed on the foot of a Cardiff player and sprained his ankle, Wenger said. It looks like it is not a question of days, but weeks.In other games, Everton fell to fifth after tying Stoke, 1-1; Aston Villa beat last-place Sunderland, 1-0; Fulham earned a comeback 2-1 win over West Ham to climb out of the relegation zone; Crystal Palace drew, 1-1, with Norwich, and West Bromwich Albion beat Newcastle, 1-0.Manchester City carried its recent form into 2014 and recorded the first goal of the year after 14 minutes when Fernandinho gave Manuel Pellegrinis team the lead at Liberty Stadium. Wilfried Bony put the hosts back in the game with a header, but City was more clinical after the interval and pulled away with goals from Yaya Tour and Aleksandar Kolarov before Bony pulled another one back.Fernando Torres helped Chelsea to a 3-0 victory over Southampton as the Blues kept pace with their rivals. The Spanish striker broke the deadlock on the hour mark, heading home a deflected cross from close range. Chelseas substitutes then combined to deliver the second, with Oscar cutting in from the left to set up Willian for a powerful shot from the edge of the area in the 71st minute.Oscar then put the result beyond doubt with a clinical finish in the 82nd minute after Eden Hazard and Ramires linked up to put the Brazilian through.Surez set a Premier League record when he scored his 20th Premier League goal in just 15 games after missing five matches with a suspension. He doubled the Reds lead in the 50th minute with a perfect free kick curled into the top left corner after Daniel Agger had headed home Philippe Coutinhos corner to make it 1-0 in the 36th.It was our best win of the season, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said. After a tough period, to get a result like that against a very good team.Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard made his return off the bench to play his first game since picking up a hamstring injury in early December.The other Liverpool club, Everton, had a less enjoyable day. Leighton Baines converted an injury-time penalty, canceling out Oussama Assaidis goal for Stoke, to earn his side a draw that could not prevent it from slipping to fifth. (top topic: 12)\n",
      "Monday night, for the first time in the 110-year history of New York Citys subways, the system was shut down for a snowstorm. Tuesday morning, with eight inches of snow on the ground in Central Park as of 7 a.m., that decision is looking pretty unnecessary.At a news conference this morning, Gov. Andrew Cuomo characterized the subway closure as a decision to err on the side of caution.\" The thing to remember about these sorts of decisions is that caution can be really expensive.As of 2014, there were 3.9 million people working in New York City, earning an average daily wage of $409. A majority of those workers commute via the citys public transit system, even when the roads are in good condition. If the subway closing led just 10 percent of people who work in New York City to take the day off today, the cost in lost labor was around $160 million  lost wages for those who are not fortunate enough to get a paid snow day, and lost productivity to the employers of those who did get paid without working.Of course, you have to weigh that cost against the cost of being caught unaware in a snowstorm thats really big. This storm could have hit New York as hard as it hit Boston. This was a good reason for a road travel ban; as Mr. Cuomo noted at the news conference this morning, unexpectedly high snowfall in Buffalo in November stranded many people on roads for hours.You can have a significant loss of life in these situations, he said.Whats harder to defend is the choice to close the subway, which is more resilient to snow than the roads are, in large part because so much of it is underground. The subway hasnt closed in previous snowstorms, including some about as big as this was forecast to be; the ability to run in the snow was even a crucial reason the subway was built in the first place. One of the reasons to keep the subway open is it lets people who must travel do so without resorting to dangerous roads.On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo and Tom Prendergast, the president of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, contended that closing the system was a smart move because its easier to return a closed system to full capacity than one that is operating with modified service. But thats inconsistent with both past M.T.A. practice and Mr. Prendergasts own comments on Monday, when he was saying there was no reason to close the underground portions of the subway system, because they are shielded from snow.Aboveground subway lines can run into trouble during blizzards, especially those that run in trenches where snow can accumulate. But N.Y.C. Transit has a plan for dealing with that: closing the aboveground parts of the system most likely to be affected, shutting down express service and using express tracks to store extra trains.This doesnt always work perfectly. In 2010, an A train got stuck in the snow for 10 hours, stranding several hundred people. The M.T.A. ended up paying a $2,500 settlement to each stranded rider. It was unfortunate (particularly for the riders), but if a stuck train is the worst thing that might happen when running the subway in the snow, that makes a very strong case for running the subway in the snow. After all, those settlements totaled a bit over a million dollars, a small price to pay for keeping the city running and working for a day.Politicians face strong political incentives to overreact to crises. Mr. Cuomo made a similar overreaction to the Ebola crisis several months ago by ordering quarantines of returning medical workers that were widely considered unnecessary and punitive by public health experts.He wasnt wrong on the politics; an unnecessary abundance of caution on Ebola polled well. But that doesnt make it smart policy. (top topic: 0)\n",

       "'In a small Brooklyn apartment, Jacob Winterhalt, a former Air Force airman, looked on as his 3-year-old daughter, Raya, and her best friend, Doris, chased each other. The girls wore sneakers. Doriss were equipped with red lights that flashed with the urgency of a distress beacon.No shoes in the house, you silly goose, Mr. Winterhalt said. Unless those are special shoes.Ive got to go to work, Raya said.Ive got to go to work, too, Doris said.O.K., said Mr. Winterhalt, 35. Have a good day.With that, he sat down at the kitchen table. The girls went back to running around the tight space as Sampa, a 7-year-old English bulldog, barked at no one in particular. Nearby, Doriss father, Joachim Carels, 39, who used to work in the fashion industry, lounged on the couch.At that moment, it was not lost on me that taking care of the two little ones had been the work of both men for the last three years.As their children grew close, these two men from very different backgrounds developed a friendship of their own, finding kinship and trust in the sometimes lonely existence of men who choose to be principal caretakers, while their wives spend workday hours at the office.They trust each other, Ana Zaldarriaga, Mr. Winterhalts wife, said during an interview a few days later at her Midtown office. I think Jake said something to Joachim, and I said: Why are you telling Joachim that? Why are you sharing that outside our circle of knowledge? And he said: That is my bro. I can talk to him about these things.They talk about their wives, she said. They talk about their future careers. They talk about their passions. They talk about their child-rearing. They talk about money.The mens bond started by accident. In January 2015, Mr. Carels (whom I grew up with in Ohio) stood outside Mr. Winterhalts door, cursing. One of the construction projects defining the Brooklyn streetscape was underway, and he found that his car had been towed.Nearby, Mr. Winterhalt smoked a hand-rolled cigarette and laughed  he had gotten three tickets for doing the same thing. The two men began to talk. They had seen each other in the neighborhood but had never really spoken. It turned out their daughters were the same age, born just a month apart.The two dads and two girls hung out a few times before an arrangement took shape: Each father would drop his daughter off at the others house for a few hours one day a week. Their wives were skeptical at first. After all, each husband was handing over a daughter to a stranger.That a genuine friendship between them evolved seems a little strange to Mr. Winterhalt and Mr. Carels, even now. Unlike other male bonds, those forged through music or sports or work, theirs was formed between two guys who did not seem to have much in common.You get sucked into the kids zone, Mr. Carels said. So its good to have a connection to reality, whatever that reality is.Mr. Winterhalt said: Any time you go through a period in life when you feel like youre alone, its nice to find someone to realize its not just me having these feelings. Theres another person whos a stay-at-home-dad who has similar concerns, with a similar personality, and we can process that with each other.Growing up on a farm in upstate New York, Mr. Winterhalt was aimless after high school. He did a stint at a community college before going into the military.He joined the Air Force in 1999 with a plan to stick it out for four years and then become a police officer. On Sept. 11, he found himself thrown from the world he knew. In his military service that came after, he traveled for assignments that he said he cannot and would not discuss.What he would speak on, briefly, were the effects of the post-traumatic stress disorder he began experiencing shortly after he left the Air Force in 2003. Those effects continue, albeit to a lesser degree, he said.Three years after he left the military, he and Ms. Zaldarriaga, who grew up in Manhattan, began dating. About a year after their 2011 wedding, when she became pregnant (on their first try, the couple said), both were making roughly equal incomes. She had risen to a great position at her company, which provides leadership development in education and business, and he earned decent money teaching at an elementary school in Chelsea and as a bartender on the Upper East Side.But neither couple wanted their daughter to spend her first years in the care of someone else. They believed their girls needed a familial foundation before going off into the world. But who would provide it?It was just kind of accepted that it had to be one of us, Mr. Winterhalt said. And Ana had the benefits. So we really didnt have a choice.I think if you talk with Ana, shell tell you, and Ill tell you, that part of her is envious that she is missing out on this time with her daughter. That is really tough for her, and rightfully so. However, if you ask me, if she knew what it was really like on a day-to-day basis, she wouldnt choose it. I dont say that negatively. Its just factual.For her, it was a hard pill to swallow, to be the one solely financial responsible for the family, Mr. Winterhalt said. Its been a huge transition for both of us. For me to be the one who relies on her financially has not been an easy pill to swallow.Mr. Carels gives the impression that he has handled that transition well. Perhaps thats because he had already put his career in the background when he got a call from his wife, Rebecca Krauss, as she freaked out while in a Penn Station bathroom in 2012.Mr. Carels, having earned an undergraduate degree in architecture, arrived in New York in 2000 and earned an associate degree in fashion design from Parsons School of Design. Afterward, he entered the production side of fashion, where he spent the better part of a decade.He met Ms. Krauss, an acupuncturist, herbalist and medical qi gong practitioner, while studying Acroyoga with her in 2008 at a Manhattan studio. Within a year and a half, they got married at City Hall, after which they moved to Colorado so she could finish her training in the use of Chinese herbs.During that time, Ms. Krauss, who is originally from Long Island, traveled to New York once a month to see clients, which is where she was on that day in 2012 when she found out she was pregnant  in one of the worlds busiest train stations.In Colorado, they had help with the baby, with Mr. Carels working full time at a bike store while Ms. Krauss finished school. When she completed her studies in 2013, they moved in with her family in East Meadow, N.Y., where Mr. Carels took over the primary duties of caring for Doris.When Ms. Krausss business took off, they moved to Brooklyn. Mr. Carels knew a return to the fashion business would mean starting over. So he stayed at home.Whatever money I was going to make was going to go toward paying someone to watch Doris, Mr. Carels said. It didnt seem mathematically to make sense. And I enjoy staying home with Doris and believe that some amount of her precociousness and language skill has something to do with the fact that I was at home with her and so engaged.Both Mr. Winterhalt and Mr. Carels can be loners. Neither actively seeks new relationships, though each maintains a small group of lifelong friends. This was something that concerned their spouses. Ms. Zaldarriaga said she knew her husband would take great care of Raya, but she didnt know if he would take care of himself.Both men said that they take a dim view of groups for stay-at-home fathers. For them, the concept seems forced. Mr. Carels tried it out a number of times, but it just wasnt for him.And at some level, why are you going? Mr. Carels asked. Are you going for you or your kid?The two fathers recently took the girls to Underwood Park in Brooklyn, talking while their daughters played. A mother commented that they must be part of some Meetup or a dads collective.No, Mr. Carels said in answer. Were just parents hanging out, like you.Besides, since they found each other, they have no real need for such a group.We joke about this, Mr. Carels said of his friendship with Mr. Winterhalt, because every time we hang out, there is some similarity that is remarkable. Some part of our life is similar enough, even though the stuff in between was radically different. There is something that makes it easy to connect with him. And the shared experience for the last three years, obviously, is enough to give us tons of stuff to talk about.The difficulties they face are akin to those experienced by generations of mothers. They, too, have suffered from a sense of isolation, often followed by the daunting task of rejoining the work force after years at home.Now, with Raya and Doris ready to enter preschool, the two fathers are feeling untethered.My passion for the last years has been my family, Mr. Winterhalt said. So I dont know what Im going to do as a job. I dont have any idea. The world is mine, and thats a great thing. Do I go back to school? I dont know. That is a little scary for me.Mr. Carels expressed similar feelings. I cant go back to some stupid job thats 9-to-5 with two weeks of vacation, he said. That doesnt fit into what weve established or what we want. Im not going to go to a bank to apply to be a teller. I have to discover how to find something I want to do and fit it in with how it will work for us.For the moment, anyway, this remains their life: two little girls running around the room, the bulldog barking, the sneakers flashing.'"

       "'IF you were born before 1946 or after 1964, you are free to go. Kindly close the door on your way out. I need a private moment with my fellow baby boomers.So. I imagine youre all feeling a little unappreciated these days. We seem to have entered one of our periodic seasons of boomer-bashing. In rapid Op-Ed succession, we children of the postwar demographic bulge have been blamed for turning religion into an indulgent free-for-all, for giving elites a bad name and for making greed respectable, or at least acceptable. Thats just this month, and just on this page. And its not only conservatives beating us with the Woodstock whip. Kurt Andersen, a confessed liberal and one of our more prolific cultural omnivores, started the latest thumping July 4 with an argument that amoral self-gratification is just the flip side of social liberation: Thanks to the 60s, we are all shamelessly selfish.The notion that our generation has been spoiled rotten is not a terribly new thought. A dozen years ago Paul Begala (of Bill Clinton and CNN fame) published in Esquire the classic of boomer-loathing, The Worst Generation. The Baby Boomers are the most self-centered, self-seeking, self-interested, self-absorbed, self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing generation in American history, he declared. Its a sturdy genre. Perhaps while Googling yourself you have come across the blog Boomer Deathwatch (Because one day, theyll all be dead), a checklist of famous boomers who hit their actuarial sell-by dates. Even Barack Obama, who styles himself post-boomer though he was born in 1961, complained in The Audacity of Hope that todays hyperpolarized political discourse began with the psychodrama of the baby boom generation.Yes, yes, this criticism is glib. We didnt start the war in Vietnam, but members of our generation fought both in it and against it, demonstrating some of the spirit of sacrifice we are not famous for. Our ranks include the outsourcers of Bain and the wizards of the Wall Street casino, but also the entrepreneurial genius of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. The Bill Clinton of Monicagate was the first boomer president, but so was the Bill Clinton of relative peace and prosperity. Our record-buying dollars gave the world disco  so sorry about that  but also Motown and Springsteen. Id say the argument will continue forever if that didnt sound like such an all-about-us, boomer thing to say.But even though the caricature is way too easy, it has stuck, and we all know that it contains more than a nugget of truth. We are an entitled bunch.This brings me to a soon-to-be released study by the incorrigible pragmatists at Third Way, the centrist Democratic think tank. The study takes a familiar refrain and presents it with a graphic wallop. Though it was intended as a wake-up call, not an indictment of a generation, it can be read as both.The authors examined two categories of federal spending over the past 50 years, representing two of governments fundamental missions. One was investments, which includes maintaining our national infrastructure, keeping our military equipped, helping assure that our work force is educated to a high standard, and underwriting the kind of basic scientific research that is too risky or long-term to attract private money. The report calls this the legacy of President Kennedys New Frontier, though the largest infrastructure project in our history, the interstate highway system, was Eisenhowers baby, a reminder of the days when Republicans still believed in that stuff. The other category was entitlements, a catchall word for the safety-net programs that provide a measure of economic stability for the aging and poor: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.You will not be surprised to hear that the red line tracking entitlements goes up while the blue line reflecting investments goes down. What is alarming is the trajectory.In 1962, we were laying down the foundations of prosperity. About 32 cents of every federal dollar, excluding interest payments, was spent on investments, only 14 percent on entitlements. In the mid-70s the lines crossed. Today we spend less than 15 cents on investment and 46 cents on entitlements. And it gets worse. By 2030, when the last of us boomers have surged onto the Social Security rolls, entitlements will consume 61 cents of every federal dollar, starving our already neglected investment and leaving us, in the words of the study, with a less-skilled work force, lower rates of job creation, and an infrastructure unfit for a 21st-century economy.Some of the entitlement bloat comes from the addition of new programs  notably the prescription drug benefit espoused by our second boomer president, George W. Bush, and the Affordable Care Act, though at least that law sets in motion offsetting measures aimed at containing the soaring cost of health care. Some of the growth is built into formulas that increase benefits faster than inflation or G.D.P. And a lot of it is us: boomers, aging into Social Security and Medicare. Weve reached the point where our working-age population over the next 30 years grows by one-fifth, and our elderly population grows 100 percent, said Jim Kessler, the senior vice president for policy at Third Way.Indignant readers are already revving up to tell me that Social Security and Medicare are sacred promises, that cutting them would be stone-hearted Republicanism. A.A.R.P., the lobby for people we used to call senior citizens until we realized that meant us, got hammered by the left earlier this year when its C.E.O. dared to convene a meeting of Washington insiders to even discuss the subject. No wonder A.A.R.P. shies away from supporting any entitlement reform.But the traditional liberal alternatives  raise taxes on the well-to-do, cut military spending  are not nearly enough by themselves. The arithmetic simply doesnt work, unless we face the fact that entitlements are a bargain we cant afford to keep, not in full.So the question is not whether entitlements have to be brought under control, but how. The Republican plan espoused by Mitt Romney and his fiscal lodestar Paul Ryan would cut the cost of entitlements largely by moving toward privatization: personal investment accounts for Social Security, vouchers for Medicare. And its not at all clear the Republicans would assign any of the savings to investing in our future.At least the Republicans have a plan. The Democrats generally recoil from the subject of entitlements. Centrists like those at Third Way and the bipartisan authors of the Simpson-Bowles report endorse a menu of incremental cuts and reforms that would bring down costs without hitting the needy or snatching away the security blanket from those nearing retirement. They include gradually raising the retirement age to compensate for the fact that we now live, on average, 14 years longer than when F.D.R. signed Social Security into law. They include obliging those of us who can really afford it to pay a larger share. They also include technical fixes like aligning the automatic cost-of-living formula with reality. To curtail the raging inflation of health costs, the government could better use its market clout to hasten electronic record-keeping, replace the fee-for-service model, reform medical malpractice laws and promote living wills. (A quarter of health care spending comes in the last year of life.) But you wont hear much of that on the campaign trail.FELLOW boomers, we have done more than our share to make this mess. Its not our fault that there are a lot of us, but we have resisted any move to fix the system. We should make a sensible reform of entitlements our generations cause. We should stiffen the spines of our politicians, and push lobby groups like A.A.R.P. to climb out of the bunker and lead. (And, by the way, we should resist the boomer temptation to take every cent of the reform from the pockets of our kids.) We should keep the heat on Congress and the president to double down on the cost-saving provisions in Obamacare.We may not be the greatest generation, but we are the largest  and we vote. We throw our weight around. What if we threw some of it in the right direction?'"

       "'ARCHITECTURES ODD COUPLEOdd coupling did not begin with Felix and Oscar. Think of all the rivals shackled together by history: Bernini and Borromini, Hemingway and Fitzgerald, Robert Moses and Jane Jacobs. The pairing of frenemies is a time-honored storytelling device used by biographers to help us understand their subjects more fully. Its as if we can truly know them only by their differences, their personal grievances and philosophical feuds. The historian Hugh Howard now applies this approach, in Architectures Odd Couple, to two of architectures most outsize personalities, Frank Lloyd Wright and Philip Johnson.Even as odd couples go, Wright and Johnson seem an unlikely choice for a dual biography. The two men interacted with so many cultural giants that Howard could have yoked each to any number of others  Wright and Louis Sullivan, Johnson and Mies van der Rohe. Then there is the matter of the achievement gap. Wright is one of the greatest architects of all time. While Johnson is certainly an important historical figure, Howard concedes that he was a lesser design talent (despite the book jackets claims to the contrary). Had it not been for Johnsons gift for publicity, his famous razor wit, his work at MoMA and the public fascination with his Glass House, it is likely that he would be remembered today as just another accomplished member of the Modernist pack. The other difficulty facing Howard is that Wright and Johnson didnt pal around all that much. Wright preferred to be as far from the East Coast as possible. For Johnson, New York City was the center of the universe.So Howard has a case to make. He unpacks the story gradually, giving us a thorough examination of the occasions when Wright and Johnson crossed paths. Along the way, he breaks out to explore that thrilling moment when modernism was taking hold in America. Howard suggests that each architect did his best work as a rejoinder to perceived slights from the other. They were essential foils for each other, and clearly discernible shifts in the careers of both men resulted when their careers collided, he argues.The attraction of a Wright-Johnson pairing becomes apparent as Howard sketches in the details and the congruences pile up. Both men were attention-hungry celebrities who remained active into their 90s. Each designed a career-defining house (Fallingwater and the Glass House). Each had his own signature fashion look. For Wright it was the cape and porkpie hat. For Johnson it was his round black eyeglasses, a borrowing from Le Corbusier. Wright was a thrice-married womanizer. Johnson was as openly gay as one could be in the mid-20th century. But these are really just surface details, and in the end, its their differences that matter more. Wright was a true originator, while Johnson was, ultimately, a very influential tastemaker, who relished his ability to recognize the talent of others.Despite their shared Midwestern origins, the two men took an almost immediate dislike to each other. Wright was almost 40 years older than Johnson when they began corresponding in 1931. Johnson had just started working as a curator under Alfred Barr at the newly formed Museum of Modern Art, and was busy preparing what would be a groundbreaking exhibition on the new International Style. As the most famous architect in America, Wright (or Mr. Wright, as he liked to be called) expected star treatment. But the 24-year-old Johnson, who had an ego to match Wrights, wasnt having it. Even though Johnson was not yet a trained architect, he had already begun to see himself as an arbiter of architectural taste. In his view, Wright was a has-been whose best work was behind him. Yet, despite his belief that Wright had nothing to say to the new architectural movement, Johnson felt he had to acquiesce to the wishes of the MoMA board and include him in the show. Johnson would later quip that Wright was the greatest architect of the 19th century. Wright would forever bristle at his treatment by the New York boys.Preparations for the show at MoMA did not go well. Johnson saw the exhibit as an opportunity to introduce European Modernists like Walter Gropius and J.J.P. Oud to the American public. In Wrights mind, it was his work that should be the center of attention. Even after Wright agreed to let his models be displayed, the power struggles continued. Angered by Johnsons lack of deference, Wright threatened to withdraw his cooperation at the 11th hour, just as Johnson was facing a catalog deadline. Johnson and his co-curator, Henry-Russell Hitchcock, had to enlist the critic Lewis Mumford as mediator to soothe the great mans wounded feelings. The roller-coaster experience of dealing with Wright proved so exhausting that Johnson ended up checking himself into a sanitarium on opening night.As fraught as this initial encounter was, Howard argues it was pivotal in Wrights development, opening his eyes to important changes in architecture. The sparring with Johnson provided the spark for his late-career burst of creativity and ultimately led to the designs for two of his most brilliant and beloved projects, Fallingwater and the Guggenheim Museum.None of this was immediately apparent from Wrights outward behavior. Wright publicly criticized the show, dismissing the work of the Europeans. Yet all the while, Howard says, Wright was quietly absorbing their style and ideas. Wright soon began to pare away the exterior ornamentation on his buildings, in keeping with Modernist ideas expressed in projects like Miess Tugendhat house. By 1936, when construction began on Fallingwater in western Pennsylvania, the change was clear. The arrangement of crisscrossing planes, balanced dramatically over a waterfall, would reflect the lessons Wright had learned at MoMA, compliments of Philip Johnson, Howard writes. Wright had fused his own ideas about organic architecture with the Europeans Modernist functionality. Having disparaged Wright for years as yesterdays man, Johnson had to acknowledge that Fallingwater was, as Howard puts it, something utterly new and different, and would have a tremendous impact on the direction of architecture.Howard also makes the corresponding case that Wright influenced Johnsons development. Johnson had always been an architectural chameleon who drew inspiration from others, especially Mies. Johnson had been grudging in his praise of Fallingwater, but after seeing Wrights lily-pad columns at the headquarters for S.C. Johnson & Son in the mid-40s, the younger architect was forced to re-examine his devotion to Miesian purity. Even as Johnson was helping Mies on his first big project, the Seagram Building, Howard suggests that Johnsons work was becoming increasingly decorative. Ever the architectural magpie, Johnson had already picked up a warm, Wrightian detail, the herringbone brick floor, and incorporated it into the Glass House, his great theoretical demonstration project. Johnson would continue to stray from his roots, shocking his Modernist fathers with his overt historical references. After Wrights death in 1959, Howard writes, Johnson took over the mantle as Americas chief architectural entertainer.Wright and Johnson may share a penchant for witty pronouncements and the genes for longevity. But in dwelling on their personal idiosyncrasies, Howard distracts us from his central claim. Did the uneasy relationship between Wright and Johnson really influence their architectural thinking, and the history of architecture in general, to the extent he suggests? The problem with Howards dual biography is that it is too much of a closed system. Its hard to believe that the innovations of the European Modernists wouldnt have eventually captured Wrights imagination without Johnsons interventions. While the tensions between Wright and Johnson probably did have some effect on their creative outlook, very likely so did plenty of other people and ideas. Sure, Felix may have succeeded in getting Oscar to clean up the kitchen occasionally, but that doesnt mean he can claim credit for making him a neat freak.'"

       "'\\n\\nWhat does it mean to multiply? We often think of multiplication as creating a kind of grid: four groups of three oranges gives us twelve oranges. This is the way multiplication is often taught  but are there other ways to think about it? This question came up recently in conversation with Kalid Azad of BetterExplained.com. Heres Mr. Azads response:I see multiplication as a way to combine the properties of various numbers. The number 2 has two-ness and the number 3 has three-ness.Multiply them together, and the result (6) will have both two-ness and three-ness, i.e. its divisible by either. We can multiply by 2 again and get 12, which has double two-ness and a single three-ness.Heres how it helps me: Remember the rules like odd x odd = odd and odd x even = even? Why is that?Well, an odd number has no two-ness. Multiplying by another odd doesnt add any two-ness, so it stays odd. But odd x even? Well, we just mixed some two-ness into the batter. The result *must* be even because we put it in there! (And even x even = a double even number, i.e. it can have some two-ness removed and still be even.)A beautiful way to put it. Take this basic concept, emphasize prime numbers and add a little color, and you get a terrific new math game by the duo at Math for Love: Primo, the backdrop for our challenges this week. Heres Math for Loves Dan Finkel and Katherine Cook:Math for Loves Primo PuzzleMore than a year ago we had an idea to build a game around what felt like one of the unsung ideas in math: Prime numbers make multiplication easy. (Why does no one learn this in school?) We realized that with the right color-coding, it would be possible to see multiplication and division as combining or removing colors.The rules for Primo are simple. Each player controls two pawns that start at the 0 circle. Players take turns rolling two 10-sided dice and applying the values to their two pawns using any of the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The first to get both pawns into the 101 circle exactly wins the game. And if you land on another player at the end of your turn, you send them back to start.For the purposes of todays puzzle, thats all you need to know. (There are more twists in the game, including cards you pick for landing on prime numbers greater than 10. You can read more about the details at our campaign website.)For example, if I have a pawn at 32 and 65, and I roll a 2 and a 4, I could multiply the 32 by 2 to land on 64, and subtract 4 from 65 to land on 61. Or I could subtract 4 from 32 to move to 28, then multiply by 2 to land on 56. There are lots of options on every turn.And now, the puzzles.1. How can you get two pawns from 0 to 101 in four rolls (thats eight numbers) without any number appearing on a die more than once?2. Its possible to solve the last problem with the additional stipulation that three of your four rolls sum to the same number. Can you find out how?3. On what number do you have the highest chance of being able to get to 101 on your next roll? (You dont have to use both dice rolls when you reach 101, though of course you may.)4. In the middle of a certain game, Katherine and I were down to a single pawn each. Hers was on 24, and mine was on a certain unnamed number. I rolled a little too forcefully, and the dice went off the table on her side.Ha, she said. If you had been at 0, you could have hit me.Then I can hit you from where I am! I said.What number was I on?I happen to really like the game and asked Dan Finkel about the colors. Do kids really use them? He responded by email:Weve found that some kids use the colors and some dont, though many end up using them in some capacity at some point. Some kids use them to check their answers. We know some parents who have played with young kids, and the colors have allowed them a proxy for multiplication that has allowed them to play even though they dont know how to multiply yet. The fact that Katherine and I both ended up using them is a good sign that they work their way in eventually.That concludes this weeks prime adventure. As always, once youre able to read comments for this post, use Gary Hewitts Enhancer to correctly view formulas and graphics. And send your favorite puzzles to gary.antonick@NYTimes.com.SolutionHeres Dan Finkel with the solution:Dan here, with the solutions to this weeks puzzles.Puzzles #1 and #2 can be solved in one go.\\n Dice 1: 2 X 6 X 8 + 5\\n Dice 2: 10 X 9 + 4 + 7\\n The sum of the numbers on the dice is 12 in 3 rolls.\\n First roll: 10 and 1. Move pawn from 0 to 11\\n Second roll: 9 and 2. 11 times 9 = 99 plus 2 is 101\\n Third roll: 8 and 3. Move pawn from 0 to 3. 3 times 8 is 24\\n Fourth roll: 4 and 5. 24 times 4 = 96 plus 5 is 101\\n The first three rolls all sum to 11, satisfying question 2.Golden Dragon also proved that it is impossible to have all four rolls sum to the same number and also keep the pawns on the board. For that proof, check out the comments.For puzzle #3, readers correctly identified 100 as the number with the greatest chance of getting to 101 on the next turn. No one gave a complete argument as to why, so Ill sketch that out here.To reach 101 from 100, you either need to roll a 1 with a single die, or two numbers with a difference of 1. Crunching the possibilities, there are 19 dice rolls with 1 in them, and 2 x 8 with a difference of 1, aside from 1, 2, which was already counted (these are 2,3; 3,4; 4,5,  9,10; and their reverse order counterparts.) Thats a total of 19 +16 winning rolls out of 100, which gives a 35% chance of winning.Compare that to the other options that are contenders (91-99) and youll see that the chances tick down as you move away from 100. At 99, for example, there are 19 ways to roll a 2 with one die, and 14 (instead of 16) ways to roll two numbers with a difference of two (aside from 2,4, which was already counted). You also have 1,1, which adds a single possibility in on the addition side of things. So thats a 34% chance. And so it goes.For puzzle #4, my answer was 16. As Golden Dragon explained:\\n Since he could have hit 24 if he had been at 0, that means that the dice must have been either 8 and 3 or 6 and 4. So whatever number he really was at needs to be able to reach 24 with either pair. Trying various combinations, I found 16 to satisfy this.\\n 16 minus 8 = 8 times 3 is 24.\\n 16 times 6 = 96 divided by 4 is 24.Ravi noticed that 1 could have solved the problem as well:\\nFrom 0, it is only 0 + 8 X 3 or 0 + 4 X 6 that hit 24. And when on 1, you could use 1 X 8 X 3 or 1 X 4 X 6 to get to 24 with either of the rolls.And that wraps it up. Thanks for all the great work!Thank you, Dr. Finkel, and thank you to everyone who contributed this week: Golden Dragon, Ravi, Robert and Allen Martin.'"

Producers hoped that importing a translated Vagina Monologues that has been playing 14 years in Mexico City, and bringing in Spanish-speaking actors with followings from stage and television, would be a recipe for renewed New York success. (The play initially ran for 1,300 performances.)  They described the production as the first open commercial run of a Spanish-language play Off Broadway. But that came to a close with Mondays announcement that the Sunday night performance had been the shows last. Even with positive notices and enthusiastic audiences, the show is not attracting the numbers needed to make this economically viable,  the producers said in a statement. We hope to announce plans to bring the production to other U. S. cities.'"
