#Reading_Assistant
Welcome to my Reading Assistant Project!

In this project, I scraped 20,000 NY Times articles and created several automated tools to assist struggling readers and their teachers. These included categorizing articles by subject (to help preview articles before reading), creating a glossary of potentially difficult words, and assigning a grade reading level to each article.

In the future, I hope to make these services freely available as an online web platform. Hope you enjoy and check back for updates!
